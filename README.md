This is an app that is used to track all of your workouts.

## Getting Started

To get started, install flutter and the Android toolchain/iOS toolchain and either use an emulator or a phone to check it out.
It's really easy to use and uses the Dart programming language so is nice and easy to use. 
To get it running on an Android phone, enable debugging in settings and plug your phone into your computer.
From here use 'flutter build * ' and replace * with your chosen platform. If android, use apk. 
Then, use flutter install and it will install the apk onto your device if it is plugged in.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).
